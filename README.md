# Basic-Battleship
A very simple game of battleship (1x1 ships)

I started to learn python going into my freshman year at Michigan State University.
After a week of learning python, I wanted to to make battleship as my first game as a challenge as to how my brain would approach it and a way to learn specific tasks.
I was unsure on how to make ships larger than a 1x1, so I made it in a single unit ship battleship game.
